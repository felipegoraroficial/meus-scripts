#My Scripts

This repository contains script functions and course scripts that I have created or learned during my studies and projects. They can be useful for me or for other people who need quick and practical solutions to common programming problems.

#How to Use

You can clone this repository to your computer or download the files individually. Each script has a comment explaining what it does, what the parameters are, the dependencies, and the expected result. You can run the scripts in your terminal or in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice.

#How to Contribute

If you would like to contribute to this repository, feel free to send a pull request or open an issue. I will be happy to receive feedback, suggestions, corrections, or new script functions. Please follow good coding and documentation practices, and respect GitHub's code of conduct.
